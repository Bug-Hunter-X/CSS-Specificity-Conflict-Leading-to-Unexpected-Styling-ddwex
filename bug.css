The following CSS code snippet demonstrates a common issue where specificity conflicts can lead to unexpected styling behavior.  The `<p>` element within the `.container` class is styled with both a class selector (`.highlight`) and an element selector (`p`). Due to the higher specificity of the class selector, the `.highlight` styles will override the `p` styles, even though `p` is declared later in the CSS file.

```css
p {
  color: blue;
}

.container {
  background-color: lightgray;
}

.container .highlight {
  color: red;
}

```

This might be unexpected if the developer intends the `p` styles to apply within the `.container` class unless they specifically overwrite them.
